# Geospatial Data Science Tutorial for IC2S2'23

This is the resource page for the Geospatial Data Science Tutorial for the [9th International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2'23)](https://www.ic2s2.org/), July 17th, 2023 in Copenhagen.

Tutorial synopsis: [https://www.ic2s2.org/tutorials.html#geospatial](https://www.ic2s2.org/tutorials.html#geospatial)

We will update this page by June 2023. In the meanwhile, check out our open course materials from [Geospatial Data Science](https://github.com/mszell/geospatialdatascience), on which this tutorial will be based. See you in Copenhagen! 👋

-- Michael, Ane, and Anastassia

## Preparations 💻

Before the workshop, please install the `gds_env` by Dani Arribas-Bel and the Geographic Data Science Lab: <https://darribas.org/gds_env/>

For the tutorial, you will need the [gds_py](<https://darribas.org/gds_env/stacks/gds_py/>) version.

<!-- ADD WHICH VERSION TO INSTALL? -->

We recommend using the Docker image according to the the [instructions](https://darribas.org/gds_env/guides/docker_install/), but a conda version is also available. Please note that the Docker image will require around 4 GB of storage space.

<!-- Do we require other preparations?? -->

## Schedule 📅

**TBA**

## About us

We come from the research group [**NERDS**](<https://nerds.itu.dk/>) (NEtworks, Data & Society) @ the Computer Science Department, IT University of Copenhagen.

[**Michael Szell**](<http://michael.szell.net/>) is associate professor in Data Science at IT University of Copenhagen, and external researcher at ISI Foundation and at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. His research quantifies the patterns behind interlinked human behavior and human-built structures through mining large-scale data sets. He follows an anti-disciplinary approach using methods from data science and network science. Michael's current focus is on sustainable urban mobility and urban data science. He has also developed several interactive data visualization platforms such as What the Street!?, and the award-winning massive multiplayer online game Pardus.

[**Ane Rahbek Vierø**](https://anerv.github.io/) is a PhD student at department of Computer Science at the ITU University of Copenhagen. She is researching bicycle networks with a focus on transport equity and urban/rural divides in cycling accessibility. Ane has a background in urban geography and geographic information science and is combining methods and insights from urban planning, geospatial data science and mobility studies in her work.

[**Anastassia Vybornova**](https://github.com/anastassiavybornova) is a PhD fellow in Data Science at the IT University of Copenhagen. The goal of her PhD project is to support the sustainability shift of human mobility by means of data- driven bicycle network planning. Anastassia has a multidisciplinary background in Transcultural Communication, Technical Physics, and Environmental Science.

## Resources 📚

This tutorial is based on materials from our course in Geospatial Data Science, offered as part of the ITU master in data science.
You can find the open course materials here: <https://github.com/mszell/geospatialdatascience>

For a general introduction to Geospatial Data Science in Python, we recommend the book and course materials by Rey, Arribas-Bel and Wolf:

* [Geographic Data Science with Python](<https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html>) (book)
* [Geographic Data Science](https://darribas.org/gds_course/content/home.html) (course)

See also the excellent introductions to geographic data analysis with Python by Tenkanen, Heikinheimo, Aagesen and Fink:

* [Automating GIS Processes](<https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>)

<!-- Add resources specifically for the intro part (Geopandas, map projections, choropleths, etc) -->

<!-- Add resources specifically for osm and osmnx) -->
