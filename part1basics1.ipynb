[Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/io.html) is capable of reading data from all of these formats (plus many more) and combines the capabilities of the data analysis library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) with other packages like [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) and [fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) for managing spatial data. \n",

    "The main data structures in geopandas are `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame` which extend the capabilities of `Series` and `DataFrames` from pandas. This means that we can use all our pandas skills also when working with geopandas - with some added spatial functionalities 🌐\n",

    "The main difference between geodataframes and pandas dataframes is that a [geodataframe](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/data_structures.html#geodataframe) should contain one column for **geometries**. By default, the name of this column is `'geometry'`. The geometry column is a [geoseries](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/data_structures.html#geoseries) which contains the geometries (points, lines, polygons, multipolygons etc.) as shapely objects.

The function has two alternative parameters 1) `crs` and 2) `epgs` that can be used to make the coordinate transformation and re-project the data into the CRS that you want to use.\n",
